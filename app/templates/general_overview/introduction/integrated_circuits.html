                <h2>Integrated Circuits</h2>

<p>As the 1950s drew to a close, electronic devices constructed using individual transistors and other discrete components were reaching the limits of technological capabilities.</p>

<p>Circuits had become so complex that size, heat dissipation, and even wiring the pieces together were significant challenges.</p>

<p>In 1959, scientists developed a solution: the integrated circuit.</p>

<p>This device replaced many discrete components with a single miniature "chip."</p>

<p>On the chip were tiny transistors and all the interconnections necessary.</p>

<h3>Integrated circuits offered several advantages:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>They were smaller and lighter than discrete devices.</li>
    <li>They were more reliable because there were fewer connections to fail.</li>
    <li>They were cheaper to manufacture.</li>
    <li>They consumed less power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Integrated circuits became the foundation of the modern electronics industry.</p>

<p>They enabled the development of the microprocessor, the "brain" of a computer.</p>

<p>Today, integrated circuits are found in almost every electronic device.</p>

<p>Integrated circuits are also known as microchips or chips.</p>

<h3>How Integrated Circuits Are Made:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Integrated circuits are made by "printing" the circuit pattern on a silicon wafer.</li>
    <li>Each wafer contains hundreds of chips.</li>
    <li>After the chips are printed, the wafer is cut into individual chips.</li>
    <li>Each chip is then tested to ensure that it works properly.</li>
    <li>Defective chips are discarded.</li>
    <li>Good chips are packaged in plastic or ceramic cases.</li>
    <li>The case protects the chip and provides electrical connections to the outside world.</li>
</ul>
<!-- <p>Integrated circuits are classified by the number of transistors they contain. There are several categories of integrated circuits:</p> -->
