## Commit Message Format
For semantic-release to work correctly, commit messages need to follow the Conventional Commits format. Here are a few examples of valid commit messages:

- fix: Fixes a bug (will result in a patch version bump)
    - Example: `fix: correct minor typos in code`
- feat: Adds a new feature (will result in a minor version bump)
    - Example: `feat: add user authentication`
- BREAKING CHANGE: Introduces a breaking change (will result in a major version bump)
    - Example: `feat: refactor authentication logic`  
                `BREAKING CHANGE: The login API now requires an email instead of username`
